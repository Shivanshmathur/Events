## Session - Automation - How I came to see the light
This is an anecdotal story of how I grew from a fanatic GUI clicker to a student of the school of automation. Nowadays there are few tasks that I don't attempt to tackle with automation. But the road was paved with pitfalls and mistakes were made, this will cover some of the mistakes, potentials for improvement and why I am enthusiastic about this.
