# Austin PowerShell
The Austin PowerShell User Group is a free monthly meeting for IT Professionals, Developers, Engineers, Systems Administrators, and anyone interested in learning or sharing information about Microsoft PowerShell. We usually host meetings first Thursday of the month at the Microsoft Store in The Domain.

## Session - Reach the next level with PowerShell
As system administrators we can use PowerShell for a variety of tasks, but what is the most efficient approach and what kind of ways can we be writing scripts? In this session I will take you through putting together a couple of commands, optimizing how we retrieve this information and finally put this all together into a function that collects all information for you.
