We usually host meetings first Thursday of the month at the Microsoft Store in The Domain.

## Session - Reach the next level with PowerShell
As system administrators we can use PowerShell for a variety of tasks, but what is the most efficient approach and what kind of ways can we be writing scripts? In this session I will take you through putting together a couple of commands, optimizing how we retrieve this information and finally put this all together into a function that collects all information for you.
