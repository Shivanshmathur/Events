# MSUG Singapore: Writing PowerShell â€“ The right tool for the job
This is the repository that contains all presentation materials that I used during my presentation for the Microsoft User Group based in Singapore on the 18th of March 2017. This includes my PowerPoint slides as well as all code used. If you feel anything is missing feel free to reach out to me directly or raise an issue on GitHub and I will make sure all materials are included.

During the presentation I discussed topics:
* Differences in tools
* Configure VS Code
* Working with VS code
* Working with the ISE and ISESteroids
