This is the repository that contains all presentation materials that I used during my presentation for the Microsoft User Group based in Singapore on the 18th of March 2017.

During the presentation I discussed topics:
* Differences in tools
* Configure VS Code
* Working with VS code
* Working with the ISE and ISESteroids
* Questions-->
